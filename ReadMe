âœ… 3. Run the Migration
(a) First-Time Migration (Initial Setup)
If it's the first migration (after defining your models in prisma/schema.prisma), run:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init
ðŸ”¹ Replace init with a relevant name (e.g., create_users_table).

npx prisma migrate dev --name update
âœ… 4. Reset the Database (If Needed)

npx prisma migrate reset
Press y when prompted.

For seeding
npx prisma db seed




<!-- After updating prisma -->

Run Prisma Migrate (or db push)
Depending on your environment:

In development (recommended):

npx prisma migrate dev --name added-breed-to-pet
This creates a new migration, updates your database schema, and regenerates Prisma Client.

If you donâ€™t want to keep migration history (e.g., in early prototyping):

npx prisma db push
Regenerate Prisma Client (if not already done)
Sometimes needed separately:

npx prisma generate
